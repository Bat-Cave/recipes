					Dear Family and Friends,
				</h1>
				<p>
					the inspiration for this recipe booko came after 30 years of trying,
					testing, failing, and mastering. the recipes included are truly the
					favorites of our family. many are requested as birthday dinners or
					mass production for large croeds. what makes these recipes so magical
					is their ability to bring loved-ones together to enjoy great food and
					even better company.
				</p>
				<p>
					one of my favorite scriptire stories is of Jesus feeding the thousands
					with five loaves and few fishes. he had compassion for these people
					who had been with him for three days with nothing to eat. He would not
					send them away hungry, so he performed a miracle which allowed them
					all to be fed.
				</p>
				<p>
					we need physical nourishment just as we need spiritual nourishment,
					and Jesus, the Master teacher, was our example of offering both.
				</p>
				<p>
					may you have many happy meals together with your family and friends!
				</p>
				<p>with love,</p>
				<p>mom/leann</p>
